# Store-Profit-Maximization-using-Excel-and-PowerPoint


The objective of this project is to analyze the sales data of a retail store to identify key factors that contribute to profit maximization. The project was carried out using Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint to create graphs and insights for presentation.

An extra column named "Age Group" was created in the data to categorize customers into three sections: teenager below age 30, adult above 30 and below 49 age, and senior above age 50. The data was then analyzed using Excel to derive insights that could inform business decisions.

Six graphs were created using Excel to visualize the data and trends in sales. The graphs included a pie chart showing the distribution of sales across different states, a bar chart showing the contribution of different channels to sales, and a line graph showing the trend in orders over time.

Some key insights from the data include:

1️⃣ Women in the teenager age group of below age 30 make more purchases than men in the same age group.

2️⃣ Women make more orders, accounting for 64% of the total orders compared to men.

3️⃣ The top three states contributing to sales are Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh.

4️⃣ The top three channels contributing to sales are Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra, which make up about80% of total sales.

5️⃣ 92% of total orders are delivered, indicating a high level of customer satisfaction with delivery.

✳️✳️ These insights were presented using PowerPoint to make it easy for business decision-makers to understand the data and make informed decisions. The presentation also included recommendations for maximizing profits, such as focusing on the top-selling states (Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh)and channels (Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra) and give some coupons/offers/ads and targeting female customers in the teenager age group.
